          My Bachelor's degree in geosciences provided me with extensive knowledge and practical experience in geology, chemistry, physics, and mathematics. The program included exciting field trips, which allowed me to apply my knowledge in real-world settings and gain valuable hands-on experience. I also completed a Bachelor's thesis that explored the genesis of unusual mineralizations in Ladinian deposits in South Tyrol, providing me with experience in conducting independent research, analyzing data, and presenting findings. Overall, my Bachelor's degree and field trip experiences have equipped me with valuable knowledge and skills in the field of geosciences.

          During my Bachelor's degree, I was actively involved in the student association as a member of the Institute Council and the Quality Assurance committee. I also served as the IT officer, ensuring that students had access to the necessary technological resources for their studies.

          In addition to my administrative roles, I participated in various social activities organized by the student association, such as field trips with first-year students. Being part of the association provided me with valuable opportunities to network with my peers, develop my leadership skills, and contribute to the betterment of the student experience.

          During my 10-month trip around Southeast Asia (including Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Borneo, Indonesia) and New Zealand, I gained valuable experience in budget travel, cultural immersion, and adaptability. I learned to navigate various modes of transportation, communicate with people from different backgrounds and cultures, and overcome challenges through resourcefulness and resilience. As a diver, I also had the opportunity to explore the underwater world in several of these countries and gain a greater appreciation for the environment and the importance of preserving it.
          
          This experience has broadened my perspective and enhanced my problem-solving and interpersonal skills.
